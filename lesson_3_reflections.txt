You would want to use a remote repository for a variety of reasons.  First of all it gives you a place away from your local 
machine to store the files.  If something happens to your local machine you still have the files.  Secondly it is much easier to 
share files with multiple developers when you have a remote repository.

Fork means make a copy of a repository on GitHub.
Clone means make a copy of repository on your local store.
A branch is a label within a repository that you may come back to.

It is advantageous to have the last known copy of the remote repository on your local machine so that you can sync with it and
get the remote changes.

You could collaborate without version control but it would be difficult.  You could have shared folders so that each collaborator
could see the other's code.  Then you could have a log in each folder so that anyone making a change to their code could log what
they changed.  Then if someone wanted to merge the chnages in they could theoretically do this using diff and the change log.

You might want to make changes in a separate branch instead of master so that you can try out the changes before changing anything 
in a working master branch.s
